			You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

			Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

			n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

			Example 1:

			n = 5

			The coins can form the following rows:
			¤
			¤ ¤
			¤ ¤

			Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
			Example 2:

			n = 8

			The coins can form the following rows:
			¤
			¤ ¤
			¤ ¤ ¤
			¤ ¤

			Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
