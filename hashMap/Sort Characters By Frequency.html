		/*
			Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

			Example 1:

			Input:
			"tree"

			Output:
			"eert"

			Explanation:
			'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
			So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
			Example 2:

			Input:
			"cccaaa"

			Output:
			"cccaaa"

			Explanation:
			Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
			Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
			Example 3:

			Input:
			"Aabb"

			Output:
			"bbAa"

			Explanation:
			"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
			Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
