		/*
			Suppose Andy and Doris want to choose a restaurant for dinner, and they both have a list of favorite restaurants represented by strings.

			You need to help them find out their common interest with the least list index sum. If there is a choice tie between answers, output all of them with no order requirement. You could assume there always exists an answer.

			Example 1:
			Input:
			["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
			["Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"]
			Output: ["Shogun"]
			Explanation: The only restaurant they both like is "Shogun".
			Example 2:
			Input:
			["Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"]
			["KFC", "Shogun", "Burger King"]
			Output: ["Shogun"]
			Explanation: The restaurant they both like and have the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum 1 (0+1).
